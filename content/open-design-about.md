Open Design + Build began as a collaborative project involving [Manhattan Hydraulics](https://twitter.com/hydraulics_nyc), Black Socialists in America's volunteer Open Tech Development (OTD) team, and BSA's broader following + community to create the Dual Power App. Through open and transparent development, we're working to distribute digital tools supporting orgs and individuals building a direct democracy.

**Designers:** We could use a hand turning our mockups and component library into realistic prototypes for engineers to follow.

**Engineers:** We have mockups, a data model they conform to, and this repo as an app scaffold. Jump and do whatever you want across the stack; we would especially appreciate:
- Leadership on the back end, potentially using [Open Sociocracy](https://www.opensociocracy.org/) but also open to a proprietary monolith or [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/) network.
- User flows modeled in [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) FSMs, while others continue building components and pages.
