Open Design + Build began as a collaborative project involving [Manhattan Hydraulics](https://twitter.com/hydraulics_nyc), the Open Tech Development (OTD) team, BSA and its broader following + community to create the Dual Power App. Through open and transparent development, we're working to distribute digital tools supporting orgs and individuals building a direct democracy.

You're welcome to join us at any of our events, or, if you'd like to get more directly, [send BSA an introduction and some of your work](https://blacksocialists.us/contact) and ask to join OTD in Basecamp.
